## Question

“The problem is, how can managers make decisions when they don’t have your skills and experience? For one thing, they have you. Good managers know that you’re the actual expert, so they ask for your opinion”

When “good managers” know technical professionals are the expert and take their advice into strong consideration, does this imply that a “bad manager” isn’t even meeting a bare minimum of consulting technical professionals? What really makes a “good manager” in the eyes of a technical professional?
