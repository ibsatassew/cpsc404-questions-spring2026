## Question

This chapter highlights the differences in priorities that will inevitably arise between you (the employee) and managers. It seems that the more you can shape your priorities to match those of the company the more leeway you can earn is equally true though.

How can I apply this thinking laterally? If I can recruit and work with other engineers on my own level on specific tasks but we can learn from each other. We can also build and present more company-preferred solutions. Should I work about being a better colleague or is it always better to be a better employee?
