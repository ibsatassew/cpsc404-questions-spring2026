# Week 4 – HYBHY Chapter 3: Creating Constructive Loyalty

**Author:** Hamim Mahdie

## Question

Chapter 3 emphasizes the importance of loyalty and trust in the employee–manager relationship, framing loyalty as a two-way but asymmetrical expectation. Kousen argues that managers often operate from fear and uncertainty, which shapes their behavior.

How does understanding a manager’s fear change how employees should interpret seemingly unreasonable decisions? Is “constructive loyalty” always compatible with professional integrity, or are there cases where loyalty to a manager conflicts with loyalty to the work or the organization?
