## Question
The chapter says great employees become valuable by promising the right amount and delivering on time, and that professionals tend to underestimate timelines. But early career, you often don’t control scope, shifting priorities, or sudden ‘urgent’ requests. If estimation is partly a manager’s job, when a deadline slips, how do you fairly assign responsibility between employee and manager? And how do you protect yourself from being blamed for unrealistic planning?
